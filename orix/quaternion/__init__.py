"""Four-dimensional objects.

In a simplified sense, quaternions are an extension of the concept of complex
numbers, represented by :math:`a + bi + cj + dk` where :math:`i`, :math:`j`, and
:math:`k` are quaternion units and :math:`i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1`. For
further reference see
`the Wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion>`_.

Unit quaternions are efficient objects for representing rotations, and hence
orientations.
